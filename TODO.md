# TODO

## High priority

* Add fxp/fxb headers or use custom file extensions:
  https://github.com/R-Tur/VST_SDK_2.4/blob/master/pluginterfaces/vst2.x/vstfxstore.h
* GUI
  * Wave display
    * Better colors to indicate that it can not be interacted with?
* Audio
  * Check modulation input/output panning
    * Use true stereo panning? https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=148865
* Check for available updates at plugin start?
* Check that zlib-acknowledgement statements are generated by cargo-about?

## Medium priority

* Unit tests for parsing parameter value text?
* GUI
  * Tooltips for parameter titles?
  * Envelopes
    * Reset values by double clicking draggers? At least for decay.
    * Display zoom level / viewport length in seconds/milliseconds?
    * Display corresponding value when hovering over dragger?
    * Display all volumes in dB?
  * Probably don't do / no longer relevant:
    * GUI: in operator freq ratio values, display number too? E.g. 2pi: 6.28
    * Add small marks to operator ratio knobs indicating factors of 2?
  * Consider adding widget for LFOs and operators showing cumulative
    frequency multiplier
  * Scrolling in dropdowns
    * iced 0.4: https://github.com/hecrj/iced/pull/872
    * Does scrolling (including touch) need to be added to baseview
      macOS code? What about other platforms?
* bench_process
  * try generating delta_frames with rng
  * try generating key velocity with rng
  * Is it a cause for concern that not keeping wave type fixed has different
    effect depending on SIMD width?
* Documentation
  * Double-click to reset knobs
  * Shift-drag knobs for fine tuning

## Low priority

* GUI
  * Mouse drag movements in pick list transfer through to envelope editor
* Consider adding saw, square and triangle waves. Maybe look at
  TX81Z waveforms. https://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/comments/rkyk6j/comment/hpgcu6r/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
* Build for Apple silicon
  * ADVSIMD (NEON) acceleration should be supported, at least by enabling the
    target feature. I'm not sure about how that is done when cross-compiling.

## Very low priority

* Process benchmark output not same on Windows as on macOS/Linux
* Record video of workflow, upload to YouTube
* Consider updating envelope and lfo values in process benchmark too. This
  would further improve usefulness of output hashing.
* GUI
  * Zoom towards center of envelope duration instead of viewport if
    envelope doesn't cover viewport? (Or maybe always)
  * Do I need to run update_host_display?
    * Should it be run on knob drag release?
* clippy
* Test that number of sync and processing parameters is equal
* suspend mode and so on, maybe just reset time, note time, envelopes etc on resume
* Fuzz Log10Table (cargo-fuzz?)
* Is it necessary to look at time signatures etc for bpm sync?
  https://rustaudio.github.io/vst-rs/vst/api/struct.TimeInfo.html
* Preset parameter from text
  * Implement simple parsing etc for all
  * DAW integration working anywhere?
* Nice online documentation

## Don't do

* Free LFO mode. Difficult to sensibly combine with per-voice LFOs
* Cache sync value in interpolatable parameters too? Don't do this, it seems
  to hurt performance.
* proper beta scaling - double with doubling modulator frequency: too late now
* Add phase knobs. This isn't compatible with the fact that the voices have
  independent phases and FM is done by incrementing the phase. It probably
  wouldn't contribute a lot to audio generation flexibility to change this
  just to add possibility of setting operator phase in addition to frequency.
* Should lock groups be taken into account when automating?
  * Setting equivalent parameter for other envelopes in same group is not
    enough. If lock groups are automated, data will be not synced between
    envelopes, meaning that a full sync would probably have to be done for
    every envelope parameter automation access to preserve current GUI
    behaviour. An option would be to change current GUI behaviour to force
    sync when changing lock groups.
  * It's most likely a bad idea to automate host inside of handler for when
    host sets parameter, since it might cause host to set parameter again
